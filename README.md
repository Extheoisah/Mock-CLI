# Mock-CLI
This a mock command line interface built in rust. It is my first program built using the rust language as a way to get familiar with Rust.

## Test
- To test and run the program, clone the repository and cd into the repository folder using terminal.
- In your terminal type ```cargo build && ./target/debug/fgit-rs``` to run the program.
- To run the shell type ```cargo build && ./target/debug/fgit-rs shell```.
- While in the shell, It accepts comands such as:
    ```help```
    ```status```
    ```completion```
    ```init```
